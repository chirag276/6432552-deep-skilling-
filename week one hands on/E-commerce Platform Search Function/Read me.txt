Binary Search implementation to search for a product from a sorted list, simulating e-commerce product search.

▶️ File:
- EcommerceSearch.java

💡 Key Concepts:
- Arrays
- Binary Search Algorithm
- Case-insensitive comparison

💻 Run Commands:
javac EcommerceSearch.java  
java EcommerceSearch

🔍 Sample Output:
📦 Available Products: [AirPods, Camera, ...]  
🔍 Enter product to search: Laptop  
✅ Product found at position: 5

📚 Theory:
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm with O(log n) time complexity.
It requires the input to be sorted to work correctly.
By dividing the search space in half each time, it quickly finds (or doesn't find) the target.
It’s ideal for searching in static lists like sorted product catalogs.
This assignment simulates how an e-commerce search engine locates items.
