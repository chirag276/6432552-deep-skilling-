📚 Theory:
Moving average is a simple algorithm used to smooth time series data and forecast future values.
It’s useful in financial forecasting when patterns and trends matter.
The sliding window sums recent values and averages them.
This reduces noise and provides a better prediction than relying on a single value.
It’s one of the basic but effective forecasting tools in finance and business analytics.
