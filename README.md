## ✅ Features

- Efficient search using `Arrays.binarySearch()`
- Clean Java structure
- Terminal input/output
- Prepared for GitHub demonstration

## 🛠️ How to Run the Program

Open terminal in the `src` folder and run:
javac EcommerceSearch.java
java EcommerceSearch
You’ll be prompted to enter a product name. Type something like Mouse or TV.
